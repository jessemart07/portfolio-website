            My budget app dubbed the "Budget Buddy" was a small mock up web
            based app where someone could create a budget and add transactions
            with amounts to keep track of their expenses. This was a fun little
            app I created using react.js and material-UI for the front-end and
            Google Firebase for the back-end. My plan is to keep working on the
            app and add some more functionality such as user authentication and
            reporting (e.g. average monthly expense in a particular category,
            which categories the user is spending too much, etc.) expressed in
            graphs where necessary.

            This was a responsive single page website used to market my wife and

            relevant information of our band such as previous gigs, upcoming
            gigs, links to social media and a contact form for booking us for
            events. This was a website crafted with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

            Ohana family website is a web platform for house sitters and pet
            sitters to use to find work. The platform seeks to connect pet and
            house owners to capable personnel who can do a good job at looking
            after their house or pet when they are not there. My role in the
            website was to create a User account system which took care of
            registration, log in, role responsibility and anything to do with
            user profiles. This website was built using PHP, HTML, CSS,
            JavaScript and AJAX.

            The DISC quiz app is based on the popular DISC personality test.
            This small app consisted of 24 questions and then a result page.
            This app was built with react.js, material-UI and Google Firebase.
            It was a fun challenge for me to build this app especially because
            it involved a lot of data manipulation in order to calculate the
            final result for the user.

            This was an app I built in order to learn the MERN Stack. It is a
            simple webapp where the user can upload a memory with a description.
            This is then saved to a mondoDB database. I used express for the
            back-end and react for the front-end. It was a fun learning
            experience for me.

      <p>
        I am a hard working and self-motivated person. I have spent the last 2+
        and a half years working as a professional musician for an International
        cruise line. Before this, I added value as a professional junior website
        developer for an IT company developing web applications. I am a highly
        flexible person and can work in an array of different environments with
        a variety of people. I am always looking for opportunities to learn and
        strive to excel in everything I am a part of.
